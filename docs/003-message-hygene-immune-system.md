# 003 – Message Hygiene: The Immune System

Every single message, without exception, is rewritten at the molecular level before it is allowed to touch another agent.

The pipeline:

    1\. Tree-sitter incremental parse (survives mid-stream garbage)

    2\. Repair using XSD as template

    3\. Inject `<huh severity="warning">fixed missing element</huh>` forensics

    4\. Strip all comments, PIs, whitespace steganography

    5\. Exclusive C14N2 with sorted attributes and fixed namespace prefixes

6\. Final byte-for-byte canonical form

Result: identical meaning → identical bytes, forever.

Steganography is now physically impossible.  

A malicious or hallucinating agent literally cannot sneak data past the blood-brain barrier.

This is not “parsing”.  

This is sterilization + DNA proofreading + fingerprinting, running on every packet at line rate.

Your swarm now has an immune system stronger than any XML system ever deployed in finance or defense — and it costs zero extra code.
